        Welcome to my personal site! I am Daniel Pérez-Parra, PhD student in Economics at the Université Gustave Eiffel (Érudite), supervised by Marine de Talancé and Catherine Bros. 
        
        My thesis examines the persistence of harmful cultural norms in West Africa. Using geospatial data and impact evaluation techniques, I analyse which policies are effective in eradicating female genital cutting, child marriage, and intimate partner violence.
        
        I currently work as a Short-Term Consultant for the Africa Gender Innovation Lab at the World Bank. In 2024, I was a Visiting PhD Student at the University of Oxford's Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE), supervised by Stefan Dercon. Previously, I served as a Research Assistant for Noam Angrist and Jorge García-Hombrados, and as a Research Consultant for the What Works Hub for Global Education at Oxford's Blavatnik School of Government.
