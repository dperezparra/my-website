  This paper provides causal evidence that geographic specialization can significantly enhance police effectiveness. Using rich administrative and survey data from Chile, we examine a major reform that subdivided police operational areas—e.g., municipalities—into smaller zones known as quadrants. On average, each municipality was divided into seven quadrants, with officers permanently assigned to these territories to allow them to develop a deep understanding of their structure, crime patterns, and communities. By exploiting the staggered implementation of the reform across municipalities, we show that this reorganization enhanced police effectiveness along multiple dimensions. Among surveyed households, twelve-month victimization rates declined by 10 percentage points (36%). In line with this result, administrative records from the police reveal a 14% reduction in reported crime. The reform also enhanced public confidence: the share of households reporting high trust in police rose by 12 percentage points (30%), while those perceiving increased criminal activity fell by 15 percentage points (36%). Consequently, the share of households investing in private security measures decreased by 7.7 percentage points (37%). Evidence suggests these improvements stem from geographic specialization, as households in treated municipalities report both greater police presence and better police performance across multiple dimensions associated with a better knowledge of the quadrants and their communities.
